# Thyroid-AI

Classification of Thyroid Disease Using AI:
The project aims to compare the performance of Artificial Neural Networks which are used predominantly in the Health industry with less complex algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression , Random Forest Regressor and Kernel SVM . In the project I have used Thyroid Disease  dataset to train the algorithm .The result shows that Artificial Neural Networks out performs the other ML algorithms and they can be used for accurate classification.
